# Project 02: Tinder speed dating analysis

**Certificate - Machine Learning Engineer**

**Bloc 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis**

## Introduction

This project aims to understand what makes people interested in each other in a speed dating context. We analyze the data collected from a speed dating experiment conducted by Tinder. The project is an exploration of attributes like Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests, and how they affect the success of a match.

This project is part of the professional certification Machine Learning Engineer (Concepteur Développeur en Science des données) and represents bloc 2 of the certification titled: "Exploratory Data Analysis".

## Project Structure

The project consists of several components:

- `speed-dating`: This directory contains the notebook, the data file, and other related files.

    - `notes.md`: Contains the notes for the project.
    
    - `speed_dating_analysis.ipynb`: This is the main Jupyter notebook that contains all the data analysis and machine learning models.
    
    - `Speed_Dating_Data_Key.doc`: This document provides a key for understanding the data.
    
    - `Speed_dating_Data.csv`: This is the dataset used for this project.

- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Project Insights

The project provides an analysis of the different factors that influence a successful match in a speed dating context. The results can be used to guide Tinder's matching algorithm and provide insights into what people find attractive in potential matches.

## Scope of the Project 

Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.

The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information. See the Speed Dating Data Key document for details.
