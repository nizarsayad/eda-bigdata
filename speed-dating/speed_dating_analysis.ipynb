    "Welcome to our comprehensive exploratory analysis of the Speed Dating Experiment dataset. In this notebook, we aim to delve deep into the factors influencing a match's outcome with the help of speed dating events, by uncovering patterns, and generating compelling insights.\n",

    "The Speed Dating Experiment dataset is a rich compilation of data from a series of speed dating events, supplemented with additional information about the participants' preferences, self-perception, and scoring on various attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we tackle multiple aspects of the data. We begin with a cleaning process, addressing missing values and transforming categorical variables to improve data interpretability. The notebook then proceeds with a series of visualizations and analyses focusing on distributions of variables, correlation studies, and bivariate analysis.\n",

    "Our goal is to try and provide a perspective on what makes people like each other, drawing from various aspects of the participants' demographic information, self-perception, and dating outcomes. By the end of this notebook, we hope to provide valuable insights into the factors that play a role in making a match."

    "\n",
    "- A significant challenge in this dataset is the high prevalence of missing values. In fact, some columns have up to 76% missing values. Dealing with such extensive missingness can pose challenges to any subsequent analysis and could lead to misleading results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In particular, there are 21 columns where more than 70% of the data are missing. This threshold was set to ensure that the retained data would provide a reasonable basis for meaningful interpretation. Columns with missingness above this level are unlikely to contribute substantially to our analysis and could, in fact, impede it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Consequently, we opted to remove these columns from the dataset as part of our initial data cleaning. The decision to remove or impute data is always context-dependent and should be based on an understanding of why the data are missing and what the implications of the different strategies might be.\n",

    "    - The speed dating event was structured into 21 distinctive phases, referred to as 'waves'. Each wave represents a unique round of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Not all waves followed the same scoring system. Specifically, the scoring process for waves 6 to 9 differed from the rest, a factor that needs to be taken into account when comparing or aggregating data across waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The data includes a variety of scores, each capturing a different aspect of the participants' responses or experiences. While some scores were consistently reported by all participants, others were only captured during specific waves. This inconsistency might influence the breadth and depth of our analysis for certain variables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Some scores were collected at multiple points throughout the study, marked by the labels '1', 's', '2', and '3', representing different time periods. It's essential to recognize that not every score was recorded at each of these time points. This temporal aspect of the data allows us to observe the evolution of certain variables over time, which can be particularly informative."

    "This script is a data cleaning and transformation process applied to the 'speed_dating' dataset. Initially, several columns (gender, race, goal, date, match, go_out, date_3) were encoded with numeric values, each representing a different category or response. To improve readability and understandability of the data, these numeric codes are replaced with their corresponding descriptive labels using Python dictionaries and the 'map' function. For example, in the 'gender' column, 0 is replaced with 'Woman' and 1 with 'Man'. This process is referred to as 'decoding'. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the dataset is split into two subsets based on the wave of the speed dating event. The first subset includes the data from waves 6 to 9, while the second subset includes data from the remaining waves (1-5 and 10-21). This is done because the scoring method varied for waves 6 to 9, and therefore it might be beneficial to analyze these waves separately from the rest. This illustrates an effective approach to handling variations within the data to ensure accurate analysis."

The reason is that participants might pay less attention to their precise scores when using a 1-10 scale, while they may distribute their points more thoughtfully when given a limited 100 point scale to work with. Therefore, transforming a 1-10 scale to a 0-100 point scale might introduce some distortion or bias in the interpretation of the data."

    "In this comprehensive speed dating analysis, several factors influencing match outcomes were identified. Key influences included participants' self-perceptions and the perceptions of their dates. The order of dates during the event, and participants' attributes such as shared interests, attractiveness, and humor, also significantly impacted match success. Additionally, matches were more likely when participants had similar ages, the same racial background, and higher mutual interest. Lastly, participants generally viewed themselves more conservatively compared to their assessments of their dates, particularly in terms of attractiveness. This analysis offers valuable insights, although its findings may not be universally applicable to all speed dating contexts."
